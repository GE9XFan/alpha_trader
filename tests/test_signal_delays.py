print("""
When a new signal arrives:
1. Premium queue: Gets signal IMMEDIATELY (0s delay)
2. Basic queue: Signal scheduled for current_time + 60s
3. Free queue: Signal scheduled for current_time + 300s

The scheduler (process_scheduled_signals) runs every second and:
- Checks for signals where scheduled_time <= current_time
- Publishes those signals to their respective queues
- Removes them from the scheduled set

BENEFITS:
✓ Delays are strictly enforced (60s for basic, 300s for free)
✓ Survives process restarts (stored in Redis, not memory)
✓ No signals lost during crashes or restarts
✓ Exact timing preserved even across restarts

Example timeline for a signal arriving at 09:00:00:
- 09:00:00 - Signal arrives, immediately in premium queue
- 09:01:00 - Signal appears in basic queue (60s later)
- 09:05:00 - Signal appears in free queue (300s later)
