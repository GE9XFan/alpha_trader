"""Utility helpers for loading Discord webhook secrets.

Secrets are stored in a separate YAML file (default: ``config/discord_webhooks.yaml``)
to keep deployment credentials outside of the main configuration that is
committed to source control. This module centralises the loading logic so
consumers can rely on a common schema and error handling.
